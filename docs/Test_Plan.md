## 2. Introduction & Test Strategy

### 2.1 Introduction
The objective of this Test Plan is to define the testing boundaries, validation workflows, tool suites, pass/fail standards, and defect classification criteria for the Hospital Management System (HMS). This plan establishes verifiable quality metrics for patient safety, clinical record integrity, and administrative uptime.

### 2.2 Test Items & Scope
The test scope encompasses all server-side application logic, database schemas, APIs, client frontends, and external interfaces defined in [`docs/SRS.md`](file:///home/abhijith/pes/sem5/se/docs/SRS.md):
- User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Patient Demographics & Record Repository
- Doctor Scheduling & Atomic Slot Booking
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) Documentation & PDF Generation
- Billing Calculation & Payment Processing
- Pharmacy Inventory Stock Tracking

### 2.3 Features to be Tested
- Form validation, business rule enforcement, and database integrity.
- Atomic concurrency handling during simultaneous appointment slot bookings.
- System response times and throughput under simulated user loads.
- Security constraints: RBAC enforcement, SQL injection mitigation, JWT integrity, and data encryption.

### 2.4 Features Not to be Tested
- Internal hardware failures of client terminals.
- Third-party payment gateway banking network down-times (mocked in staging).
- External carrier delivery latency of SMS messages beyond the gateway dispatch confirmation.

### 2.5 Testing Approach & Methodology
A multi-tier verification strategy is adopted:
- **Unit Testing**: Automated tests verifying individual functions and controllers (Target: ≥ 80% coverage).
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying module communication, database transactions, and API routes.
- **System & E2E Testing**: Validating complete business workflows from patient intake to discharge.
- **Security Testing**: Dynamic vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and access boundary audits.
- **Performance & Load Testing**: Stress testing concurrent users via JMeter/k6.

## 3. Section 3: Item Pass/Fail Criteria, Suspension & Resumption

### 3.1 Item Pass / Fail Criteria
- **Pass**: A test case is declared **Passed** if the actual software output, state transition, and database persistence match the expected behavior specified in the test case without unhandled errors or data corruption.
- **Fail**: A test case is marked **Failed** if any discrepancies occur between expected and actual results, if an unhandled runtime exception is raised, or if response times breach specified NFR SLAs.
- **Exit Quality Gate**: 100% of critical severity defects and 95% of high severity defects must be resolved and verified before staging deployment.

### 3.2 Suspension Criteria
Testing execution on a module or system build **SHALL** be suspended under the following conditions:
1. Occurrence of a **Blocker / Severity 1 Defect** that renders the primary authentication, database layer, or test environment inaccessible.
2. Corruption or unintended teardown of staging test databases.
3. More than 30% of scheduled test cases failing in an initial smoke test suite.

### 3.3 Resumption Requirements
Testing **SHALL** resume only when:
1. A hotfix or new build addressing the root cause has been built, tagged, and deployed to the staging environment.
2. A formal defect resolution note is supplied by the engineering team.
3. Automated regression and smoke suites execute with a 100% pass rate.

## 4. Section 4: Test Deliverables

The QA engineering team will generate and maintain the following formal deliverables:
1. **Master Test Plan Document**: This document (`docs/Test_Plan.md`).
2. **Test Case Specifications**: Executable test suites, Postman collections, and manual test scripts.
3. **Automated Test Scripts**: Unit and integration test scripts managed within the repository.
4. **Test Execution Logs**: Automated test runner logs, CI/CD pipeline artifact reports.
5. **Defect / Incident Reports**: Detailed bug tickets filed in the issue tracker (including reproduction steps, logs, and screenshots).
6. **Final Test Summary Report**: Post-testing analysis detailing test coverage metrics, pass/fail ratios, residual risks, and release recommendations.

## 5. Section 5: Testing Tasks, Environment, Responsibilities & Schedule

### 5.1 Section 5.1: Security Validation Plan
Security validation is a critical requirement due to the sensitive nature of Protected Health Information (PHI). The following validation protocols are mandatory:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SecStart([Initiate Security Validation]) --> V1[5.1.1 RBAC & IDOR Boundaries]
    V1 --> V2[5.1.2 Input Sanitization & Injection Defense]
    V2 --> V3[5.1.3 Authentication & Session Tamper Testing]
    V3 --> V4[5.1.4 Data Cryptography Verification]
    V4 --> V5[5.1.5 Immutable Audit Log Validation]
    V5 --> SecEnd([Security Sign-off Approved])
```

#### 5.1.1 Authentication & Session Hijacking Validation
- Verify that password hashing utilizes salt with Argon2id or bcrypt (minimum cost factor 12).
- Validate that brute-force attacks trigger account lockouts after 5 consecutive failed attempts (`FR-AUTH-02`).
- Verify that JWT tokens reject invalid signatures, expired timestamps, and `alg: none` manipulation.

#### 5.1.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & IDOR Validation
- Verify Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) prevention: Patient A cannot access Patient B's records by altering URL parameters or request bodies (e.g., `GET /api/v1/patients/102/records`).
- Ensure non-clinical staff (Receptionists/Pharmacists) receive HTTP `403 Forbidden` when attempting to query or edit clinical diagnosis records (`SEC-REQ-1.1`).

#### 5.1.3 Injection Attack Validation
- Execute automated vulnerability sweeps (OWASP ZAP) against all search fields, login forms, and appointment filters to test for SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Confirm parameterized queries / ORM prepared statements are strictly utilized.

#### 5.1.4 Data Cryptography Verification
- Verify database fields storing sensitive PII/PHI (patient diagnoses, prescriptions) are encrypted at rest using AES-256 (`SEC-REQ-1.2`).
- Inspect network packet traces via Wireshark to confirm zero unencrypted plain-text transmissions and enforce TLS 1.3 with HSTS enabled.

#### 5.1.5 Immutable Audit Trail & Log Integrity
- Verify that accessing, downloading, or modifying patient records immediately appends a non-deletable log entry with UTC timestamp, User ID, and IP address (`SEC-REQ-2.1`).
